## Below are two functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can
## cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned
## by makeCacheMatrix above

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
